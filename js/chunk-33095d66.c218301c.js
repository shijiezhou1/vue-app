A lot of people do not care about how\\r\\n    their behavior\\r\\n    influences of society. For example, beaches polluted by raw sewage, the factory pollutes the air,\\r\\n    and the pollution of using disposable dinnerware is all around the world. However, people care about their own money\\r\\n    by offering\\r\\n    them a reward regarding their good behaviors. Similarly, a credit score level can indicate the responsibility of a person, and most people in the world use the credit score system because they can gain more financial assistance in their life. The higher their score, the more likely they can pay less interest when trying to make a huge purchase or loan. Many credit score companies in the world have established a system of personal scores based on credit utilization.\\r\\n    For example, Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Those three companies are famous in the United\\r\\n    States. A number\\r\\n    of inquiries, Different types of credit, credit age, credit history, and payment history are the major parts to determine someone’s score. Most recently, Sesame Credit had launched the social credit system to primary\\r\\n    cities by the Alibaba\\r\\n    Company in China.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app-c1.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    According to the article Cashless society, Cashed Data by Shazeda Ahmed, states:\\r\\n    “Sesame Credit’s\\r\\n    scores are the most popular example of how a national Chinese social credit system might someday\\r\\n    operate, and provides\\r\\n    a sense of what considerations Chinese companies, citizens, and the state thinks should go into such\\r\\n    a system”\\r\\n    (Ahmed). The Alibaba Company has incorporated all the expense of everyone and try to come up with a\\r\\n    proper algorithm\\r\\n    about their score. It is significant to have completed software with an algorithm to determine their score corresponds to how they behave, and how responsible and trustworthy they are. Hence, we have come up with the\\r\\n    idea of Triton\\r\\n    Credit, which it is similar to the credit system since it is a useful tool to verify each other\\r\\n    Creditworthiness.\\r\\n    First of all, Triton Credit systems set up at the University of California, San Diego, and\\r\\n    everyone supposed\\r\\n    to participate in the systems since it incentivizes if you are behaving well on the campus. In other\\r\\n    words, people\\r\\n    who have contributed to the campus deserve to prize. Triton Credit can keep track everyone’s\\r\\n    behavior. Although\\r\\n    it is not mandatory to force them to do “good things/volunteer”, it is useful to have the\\r\\n    application to remind\\r\\n    how they should act on the campus to remain a good score. Likely, students at UCSD are\\r\\n    supposed to study\\r\\n    hard so that they can graduate with the best GPA. The prototype of the application is shown below\\r\\n    how Triton\\r\\n    Credit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app-c2.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    Moreover, they have access to the website page to see their score as well. The score is\\r\\n    not public\\r\\n    to everyone unless they become friends with each other. Therefore, no one can see your score or\\r\\n    judge your score\\r\\n    if they are not part of friends on their list. Triton Credit will keep the privacy safely, and only useful if students participated in the system. See the figures below. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul class=\\"\\" style=\\"list-style: upper-roman;\\">\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Platform Virtualization</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Sensing and Semantics</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Opacity and Transparency</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Platform Sovereignties (Governance)</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Externalities and Boundaries</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Equity</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Automation at the Edges</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Non-Standard Times</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Programmability</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Aesthetics and Affect</li>\\r\\n    <li class=\\"\\">Addressability and Dimensionality</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"images/web1.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"images/web2.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    In the real world, it is difficult to control the abusive power and bad behaviors around society. To emphasize, the government has tightened restrictions on criminals. The disasters still occur every single year in different\\r\\n    areas. No matter\\r\\n    what reason it causes, their behaviors become a high risk to us and endanger our lives. Triton\\r\\n    Credit does not\\r\\n    make the campus a better place, but the system can lower the risk. The standard line can represent\\r\\n    someone’s comprehensive\\r\\n    quality evaluation. Since all the human behaviors can record as data, it is more convenient to\\r\\n    automatically put\\r\\n    them on the right level. For example, if you have a lower credit score, you are limiting to open the\\r\\n    number of\\r\\n    credit cards and the amount of credit card line. According to the article Credit Ratings and Capital\\r\\n    Structure\\r\\n    by Darren J. Kisgen, he mentions: “If ratings contain information, they will signal overall firm quality and firms would be pooled with other firms in the same rating category. In the extreme, all firms within the\\r\\n    same rating\\r\\n    the group would be assessed similar default probabilities and associated yield spreads for their bonds.”\\r\\n    (1039).\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app-c4.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    The same credit spreads can distinguish the different levels for different users. The high recompense\\r\\n    requires a long-term\\r\\n    working and much effort to in exchange for sure. Arguably, Triton Credit contains the same method to\\r\\n    determine\\r\\n    the behavior in each standard to different types of rewards. In terms of social well being,\\r\\n    Triton Credit\\r\\n    can provide better management to the campus. The students can incentivize to behave well. There\\r\\n    are advantages\\r\\n    and disadvantages to the Triton Credit. Social behaviors can affect their score. Also, they can\\r\\n    use that Triton\\r\\n    Credit to cover the loss on their academic field especially in an emergency like absence. On the\\r\\n    other hand, Triton\\r\\n    Credit is not emphasizing the punishment rather than lowering their score. They need to\\r\\n    take time to\\r\\n    repair their score and make up the points by spending more their time to help others. The basic rule\\r\\n    on the Triton\\r\\n    Credit can regulate student’s behaviors. Hopefully, Triton Credit suppose to help more students and build a peaceful perspective.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app1.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app2.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app3.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/app4.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Work Citation:</b>\\r\\n    <br> Ahmed, Shazeda. “Cashless Society, Cached Data: Security Considerations for a Chinese Social\\r\\n    Credit System.”\\r\\n    The Citizen Lab, 8 July 2017,\\r\\n    www.citizenlab.ca/2017/01/cashless-society-cached-data-security-considerations-chinese-social-credit-system/.\\r\\n    <br> Kisgen, Darren J. “Credit Ratings, and Capital Structure.” The Journal of Finance, vol. 61, no.\\r\\n    3, 2006, pp.\\r\\n    1035–1072.

For instance, cell phone cases are invented due to the fact that it can protect the cell phone for the long term, and the cell phone did not come out before the touch screen smartphone.\\r\\n    Of course, not only a conventional concept but also the aesthetics is being considered as part of the major element.\\r\\n    Since the market demand is different and people would like a better look at their products.

That meant all the new creative artwork and productions can result in the prospective market. For example, Ermal Cleon Fraze invented the beverage can with the pull tab. The idea behind that is Ermal forgot to bring the bottle beer opener when he wanted to drink beer. At this point, the past experience provides Ermal a\\r\\n    great experience to solve with drinking cans issue and the humanizing design choices on product help him to develop his opening mechanism idea on can since the 1980s. In addition, 3D printing had provided more opportunities for us to access our own design. Even though the 3D object is not perfect in both mechanism and stability, such as material property, it\'s expanding the “weird” thinking in our mind. Roy Ascott had talked about how the artist\\r\\n    associated\\r\\n    with the scientific method create their art piece, “ In the process, and reflecting upon their previously contrived\\r\\n    limitations of behavior, they become aware of the flexibility of their responses, their resourcefulness and\\r\\n    ingenuity\\r\\n    in the face of difficulties” (Ascott 132). He indicated that the significance of creative viability for students.\\r\\n    As the use and pattern changes in society, many impossible objects are tested and exanimated by most people.</p>\\r\\n<p>No double the Toilet Paper Holder is a tiny invention, and it sometimes may not truly function in the society. The process of that idea is important for us to set high expectations for ourselves. Then, when we put more effort into creating a new set of projects and ideas, it actually comes true to what we look forward to seeing. “Consequently\\r\\n    the artist would do well to examine with some precision the nature of the special activity which gives rise to his own art” (Ascott 129). Along with the improvement of 3D printing, there is a practical invention when people try to get the part that they want. And that could can the structure of society. People do not need to walk outside to buy a small component, but instead of printing the losing part that they want. Thus, with the scientific\\r\\n    manufacture,\\r\\n    a 3D printing service would be suitable for us to discover more aesthetics in produce.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Material:</h5>\\r\\n<p>1.75mm 12oz ABS Premium 3D Printer Filament Spool, Red</p>\\r\\n<p>1.75mm 2oz ABS Premium 3D Printer Filament Spool, Black</p>\\r\\n<p>1.75mm 8oz ABS Premium 3D Printer Filament Spool, Transparency</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/cage2.png\\" alt=\\"img\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/cage1.png\\" alt=\\"img\\">\\r\\n<iframe width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"400px\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oXhJ_pPiWc\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n<p><b>Works Cited: </b>Ascott, Roy. “The Construction of Change.” The New Media Reader, edited by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick\\r\\n    Montfort, London, England, Michael Crumpton, 2003, pp. 128-32.</p>"},{"img":"/images/9images/5.jpg","msg":"Logo Design","des":"Learn about me","html":"<h3 class=\\"\\">Logo Design</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo5.jpg\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo4.jpg\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo9.jpg\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo1.jpg\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo3.jpg\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo10.jpg\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/sjlogo2.jpg\\">"},{"img":"/images/9images/6.jpg","msg":"Coconut Factory","des":"A game design to have fun","html":"<h3>COCONUT FACTORY</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n    In the project of coconut Factory, the aesthetic perception is to educate people about the significance of coconut.\\r\\n    The background is a coconut factory we made through Adobe Illustrator.

In general, a game can reflect historical events and cultural development in our society. Sherry Turkle, the author who writes about her perspective of the video game, mentioned some concepts relative to the purpose of the game in article Video Games and Computer Holding Power. he states, &ldquo; But analogies between the two screens ignore the most important element behind the game seduction: video games are interactive computer microworlds&rdquo; (Sherry 501). Most people believe the harm to a video game rather than a TV show. She compared television with the video game in this case. Of course, video games are not only available in large video game room. Most of us own a smart TV, and people could play puzzle games, vocabulary games, and chess to train their minds. At the same time, it is unreasonable to state that the game is the only &ldquo;mindless&rdquo; Even though there are many games wastes our time, a role-playing game can implicitly tell about the concept or story which requires a player to discover. It is similar to when we read a book, and it takes us time to comprehend.</p>\\r\\n<p>Moreover, video games present the ideal world in our mind. Sherry Turkle introduced\\r\\n    a story of Jarosh, a young kid\\r\\n    pursued the significant meaning comparing to the others pinball game. &ldquo; Arcade-game\\r\\n    manufacturers were quick\\r\\n    to see the advantage of using the computers within the games to remember the names &ndash; or at\\r\\n    least the initials\\r\\n    &ndash; of the top player who have used it since its memory was last cleared&rdquo; (Sherry 504).\\r\\n    That means the\\r\\n    top players in the game would be recorded by the computer. Correspondingly, their race, age, and sex\\r\\n    keep private\\r\\n    which it protects the right of the player and did not expose the abilities of players immoderately.\\r\\n    In the Jarish&rsquo;s\\r\\n    confessions, he told that he could achievement and design the way, what the game should look like.\\r\\n    For this reason,\\r\\n    artists and game designers can break down the restriction of a game. The video games are more\\r\\n    humanized, and it\\r\\n    relates to our daily life, such as the technology of Virtual Reality. In this strong relationship,\\r\\n    the idea of\\r\\n    my game is to train the player&#39;s mind. The highest score would be shown on the top when they\\r\\n    escape the zombie\\r\\n    with less time. The idea of my escaping zombie game is analogically similar to what Jarosh expect.\\r\\n    &ldquo; The Dungeons\\r\\n    and Dragons way of thinking, with its thick books of rules, seems more exciting and more challenging\\r\\n    than history\\r\\n    or real life or fantasy play where the rules are less clear&rdquo; (Sherry 509). For me, I design\\r\\n    the game to be\\r\\n    more creative. Those zombies are not the only obstacle, but also a helpful tool to pass the game in\\r\\n    short period time.\\r\\n    They can use those bodies to level up the ground, which may help a player reach the ground on the\\r\\n    top of the\\r\\n    scene. Most importantly, it does not limit the way how a player uses those zombie bodies as long as\\r\\n    they use it\\r\\n    as a brick. I believe that people would find the best way to figure out how to escape and choose the\\r\\n    right exit\\r\\n    door.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/unity-game1.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/unity-game2.png\\" alt=\\"\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Works Cited: </b> Turkle, Sherry. \\"Video Games and Computer Holding Power.\\" The New Media Reader, by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Nick Montfort, edited by Michael Crumpton, 2003, pp. 1-803.</p>"},{"img":"/images/9images/9.jpg","msg":"Practical Cup","des":"A 3D cup that makes by meshmixer","html":"<h3>Practical Cup</h3>\\r\\n<p>Based on the information and daily communication strategies, I had created a piece of artwork – Canning cup that it has a conceptual relationship about what Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby had stated. We are seeing all\\r\\n    kinds of\\r\\n    the invention, such as a helicopter or the airplane, and all those ideas come from our nature in reality.\\r\\n    Both authors\\r\\n    mention that, “Speculative design props function as physical Synecdoche, parts representing wholes\\r\\n    designed to\\r\\n    prompt speculation in the viewer about the world these objects belong to” (Dunne & Raby). Humans mime\\r\\n    their structure\\r\\n    to make transportation. Those productions could seem like the ideas of speculative everything\\r\\n    when humans\\r\\n    do not invent that transportation plentifully. What I make is a piece of the cup with a special handle on it. It does not look like a cup any for most of us since it has the handle aside like a bird\'s mouth. The\\r\\n    feature of this\\r\\n    the cup is to solve the problem of dripping water from the cans drink. For instance, a freezing coke could\\r\\n    make your\\r\\n    table wet. However, this cup can prevent this issue. The edge of the cup has four small obstacles to\\r\\n    stabilize\\r\\n    the canning drink inside. It works not only at home but also outside in your car, and the design of the\\r\\n    handle\\r\\n    It is more convenient to catch up with the table or hard cardboard. Thus, this cup is an alternative way to improve the quality of our daily life. </p>\\r\\n<p>Moreover, our invention derives from the need for environment. The limitation tells us that we need a container to carry more water. Our human develops and explores what is important to our life. The best way to\\r\\n    solve that\\r\\n    it is to have something to store water in the ancient era. Marshall McLuhan states, “Environment is not\\r\\n    passive\\r\\n    wrappings, but are, active processes which are invisible.” (Marshall p68). All the media occurs at the\\r\\n    point of\\r\\n    view of us, which means we shape the way how it is. There is no metaphor and any prediction to tell those\\r\\n    people\\r\\n    to make an item. All of them are based on conceptual art and ideal form to present it to us. My second piece called Powder Container. This container does not specify what to put on it. Instead, you can fill\\r\\n    with the\\r\\n    material that each time consumes 50 grams, which is no limit to use. What it relates is the convenient function to save time. The container can load up to 150 grams and use them separately. From a social perspective, people prefer to use less time to solve their organizational issue and this proposition can satisfy what they need. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/thecup.jpeg\\" alt=\\"\\" />\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/thecup1.jpeg\\" alt=\\"\\" />\\r\\n<img src=\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shijiezhou1/Artemis/master/img/thecup2.jpeg\\" alt=\\"\\" />\\r\\n\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<p>Agel, Jerome.
