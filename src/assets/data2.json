They\r\n    want to have the camera to detect person\u2019s face. We can simply make the emotion change base on cartoon images\r\n    or\r\n    facial detection. We can imitate or control the image to talk, to speak, to act like how we do. And that is\r\n    the\r\n    trend of how it becomes useful when communicating with others. A 3D object can give much more detail than a 2D\r\n    image. For example, we always search for Google street view because it makes more sense to see what it is\r\n    rather\r\n    than reading the map on a piece of paper to describe what street it is.<\/p>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar1.png\" alt=\"ar\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar2.png\" alt=\"ar\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar3.png\" alt=\"ar\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar5.png\" alt=\"ar\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar6.png\" alt=\"ar\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar7.png\" alt=\"ar\">\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/shijiezhou1\/Artemis\/master\/img\/ar8.png\" alt=\"ar\">"
